## Summary

Web application in JavaScript/TypeScript. Projeto funcional, calculadora-financeira-pwa

## Problem / why it exists

The project delivers a web interface or utility for a specific scope, with focus on the browser as runtime and no dependency on its own server.

## Architecture

- Presentation layer: components and pages that render the interface.
- Logic layer: functions and hooks that process data and state.
- Communication: HTTP requests to external APIs or local data, when applicable.

The build is done with Vite (or equivalent tool), generating static files ready for hosting.

## Technologies

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- react
- react-dom
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- typescript
- vite
- vitest
- jsdom
- @testing-library/react
- @testing-library/jest-dom

- .gitignore, BRIEF.md, index.html, package-lock.json, package.json, README.en.md, README.md, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts


## Trade-offs and decisions

- Static build: easy to host (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify) without a server.
- Minimal dependencies to reduce maintenance surface.
- Browser as the only runtime required.

## Known limitations

- Runs in the browser; depends on internet connection for external resources.
